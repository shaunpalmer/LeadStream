# 🔥 How to Outshine PixelYourSite with LeadStream: Positioning, Pitch, & Playbook

## What’s Actually Working for PixelYourSite?

PixelYourSite hooks users by claiming a **“Complete tracking solution for Meta Pixel, Google Analytics 4, and Google Tag Manager.”** They don’t stop there—here’s the formula behind their appeal:

* **Feature Parade:** Install Meta Pixel, GA4, GTM, custom scripts, Consent Mode, WooCommerce integration, and more.
* **SEO/Keyword Overload:** Their copy name-drops every platform and feature imaginable (Meta, Google, Woo, EDD, TikTok, Pinterest, Bing, Consent, etc.).
* **Free Training & Video:** Eye-catching thumbnails with screenshots + a friendly face + a direct benefit headline.
* **Automated Events:** They tout coverage for every possible event—form submissions, scroll depth, time on page, comments, downloads, signups, logins, you name it.
* **Woo/eCommerce Hooks:** Direct integration with WooCommerce and EDD to capture the eCommerce market, but this isn’t always needed for non-shops.

## Where They Fall Short (Your Angle)

PixelYourSite treats **form and lead tracking as “just another feature.”** Their heart is in eCommerce, not agencies or lead gen.

* **Customization & Agency Needs:** Their generic script injection is not tailored for specific forms or actions. No per-form, per-action analytics.
* **Simplicity for Non-Developers:** Their “quick start” is basic; the all-in-one approach quickly overwhelms non-tech users.
* **Event Context:** “Form submission” means little without context. They don’t help you see **which** form, **which** button, or **where** the conversion really happened.

## How to Win: Positioning LeadStream

### **Focus Laser-Sharp on Lead, Form, and CTA Tracking**

Not just another pixel/analytics installer—**LeadStream is “conversion first.”**

> “See exactly which forms and calls-to-action deliver real leads, not just pageviews.”

### **Agency/Marketer Angle**

* “Built for marketers and agencies who want conversion data, not just traffic.”
* “Works instantly with every major form builder—WPForms, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, Contact Form 7.”
* “Tracks CTA buttons, phone links, email clicks—anything that drives leads.”

### **Custom Event Wizard (Your Quick-Start Secret Weapon)**

* “Choose your platform, pick your form, and get instant working tracking code. Done.”
* “No coding. No manual setup. Copy/paste—see leads appear in GA4, Meta, TikTok, or Triple Whale.”
* “Dead simple. No e-commerce bloat. No complicated settings. Just lead/CTA tracking.”

### **Education + Screenshot Game**

Copy PixelYourSite’s **YouTube+Screenshot formula**:

* Show the “Quick Start” UI
* Show a real analytics dashboard with events like “WPForms: Get a Quote (Landing Page)” tracked as first-class data.
