## 2.12.1 - Admin Pagination Icons + Dashicons
- FIXED: Prev/Next/First/Last pagination icons in LeadStream admin tables could appear invisible when pseudo-elements were reset. Restored dashicon-based :before icons and ensured visibility across admin color schemes.
- ADDED: Explicit Dashicons enqueue on the LeadStream settings page to guarantee icon font availability.
- POLISH: Disabled pager buttons now show appropriate (grey) icons; numeric and arrow links look consistent for Phone and Call Outcomes tables.
- COMPAT: Prevented duplicate icons by scoping/removing prior Unicode ::after arrows where needed; kept screen-reader labels intact for accessibility.

## 2.11.0 - Admin Datepicker + Pretty Links Accordion UX
- ADDED: Calendar datepicker (Flatpickr) for all From/To filters on Pretty Links and Phone tabs
- ENHANCED: Re-initializes datepicker after AJAX table updates for seamless filtering
- ADDED: dd/mm/yyyy placeholders for consistent visual format
- ENHANCED: Pretty Links tab now matches Phone tab with collapsible sections (Stats, Quick Access, All Links)
- POLISH: Quick-jump button row and saved accordion state for smoother navigation

## 2.10.0 - Pretty Links Filters + CSV Export
- Filters in Pretty Links table: From/To, Redirect type, Search, Per-page
- CSV export of current view (secure admin-post with nonce)
- New Redirect column and defensive defaulting for legacy data
- Fixed wpdb::prepare warnings (prepare only when placeholders exist)


## 2.12.0 - Mobile Call Bar: Alignment + Shortcode UX
- ADDED: Button alignment (Left/Center/Right) with live admin preview
- ADDED: Alignment shortcode attribute `align="left|center|right"`
- ENHANCED: Shortcode now takes precedence over auto-inject on pages where itâ€™s used
- ENHANCED: Prevent multiple Call Bars when shortcode is inserted more than once
- POLISH: Inline help paragraph with three shortcode examples inside the Call Bar settings
- DEFAULT: Mobile-only behavior retained; desktop remains off by default
