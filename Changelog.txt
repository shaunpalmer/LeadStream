## 2.12.0 - QR logo polish + tiny LS badge (free)
- QR modal: logo size slider (8–20%) with default 16%, knockout padding, ECC auto-bump, hiDPI export, strict quiet-zone on PNG/pop-out, and 7:1 contrast warning.
- Print guard: ensures module ≥ 4 px at 1024 print size; exports remain tack-sharp.
- UI polish: color pickers, hints, and safer defaults; filename and pop-out improvements.
- Added 10px LS dot in footer for free installs (tooltip + noscript). Paid stubs disable it via constant/filter/option.
- Settings: grayed-out LS badge toggle placeholder; auto-enables on paid.
- Misc: centered badge on mobile; placement resilient near edges.
