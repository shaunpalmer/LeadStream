## 2.12.2 - Phone Tracking Baseline: Reliable Frontend Enqueue, Robust AJAX, Anti‑Dupe, Debug Gating
- FIXED: Frontend enqueue for phone tracking script. Assets loader now initializes on both admin and public pages, ensuring `assets/js/phone-tracking.js` is present when phone tracking is enabled and numbers are configured.
- ADDED: Admin-only HTML comments to verify lifecycle:
	- In <head>: `<!-- LeadStream: wp_enqueue_scripts fired; this is where we queue phone tracking (Assets::enqueue_phone_tracking) -->`
	- In <footer>: `<!-- LeadStream: phone tracking enqueued (handle: leadstream-phone-tracking) -->`
	These comments only appear for admins on the frontend, purely for verification.
- ENHANCED: Localized config publishes both `ajaxUrl` and `ajax_url` for compatibility across consumers. Also added a default selector fallback so plain `tel:` links are always tracked even if custom selectors are empty.
- ENHANCED: Tracker JS hardening (`assets/js/phone-tracking.js`):
	- Resolves AJAX endpoint robustly: `ajaxUrl || ajax_url || window.ajaxurl || '/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php'`.
	- Defaults selectors to `a[href^="tel:"], .ls-callbar a` when none provided.
	- Sends both `nonce` and `_ajax_nonce` for broader server compatibility.
	- Implements smart delivery (`fetch` with `keepalive` + `sendBeacon` fallback on visibility/pagehide) to avoid dropped posts on mobile when the call UI steals focus.
- ADDED: Server-side anti-duplication (2s window). Collapses accidental double posts (e.g., fetch + beacon or rapid double taps) via a short-lived transient key combining visitor id, phone, origin, and a 2s bucket. Returns `{ ok: true, dupe: 1 }` without inserting a second row.
- ENHANCED: Health panel (Phone tab) continues to show whether the script would enqueue and the exact script URL; added above admin-only comments to front-end for cross-checking.
- CHANGED: Debug badge (`LeadStream Phone tracking active`) is now gated behind WP_DEBUG and `?ls_phone_debug=1` (admin-only). It will not appear in production.
- COMPAT: No breaking changes to endpoints. The AJAX handler accepts both nonce parameter names; payload now uses URL-encoded form in addition to existing FormData compatibility.
- NOTES: If you cache/minify JS, purge your cache after this update. Ensure tracked numbers are configured in Phone settings; selectors are optional but can augment matching when needed.

## 2.12.1 - Admin Pagination Icons + Dashicons
- FIXED: Prev/Next/First/Last pagination icons in LeadStream admin tables could appear invisible when pseudo-elements were reset. Restored dashicon-based :before icons and ensured visibility across admin color schemes.
- ADDED: Explicit Dashicons enqueue on the LeadStream settings page to guarantee icon font availability.
- POLISH: Disabled pager buttons now show appropriate (grey) icons; numeric and arrow links look consistent for Phone and Call Outcomes tables.
- COMPAT: Prevented duplicate icons by scoping/removing prior Unicode ::after arrows where needed; kept screen-reader labels intact for accessibility.

## 2.11.0 - Admin Datepicker + Pretty Links Accordion UX
- ADDED: Calendar datepicker (Flatpickr) for all From/To filters on Pretty Links and Phone tabs
- ENHANCED: Re-initializes datepicker after AJAX table updates for seamless filtering
- ADDED: dd/mm/yyyy placeholders for consistent visual format
- ENHANCED: Pretty Links tab now matches Phone tab with collapsible sections (Stats, Quick Access, All Links)
- POLISH: Quick-jump button row and saved accordion state for smoother navigation

## 2.10.0 - Pretty Links Filters + CSV Export
- Filters in Pretty Links table: From/To, Redirect type, Search, Per-page
- CSV export of current view (secure admin-post with nonce)
- New Redirect column and defensive defaulting for legacy data
- Fixed wpdb::prepare warnings (prepare only when placeholders exist)


## 2.12.0 - Mobile Call Bar: Alignment + Shortcode UX
- ADDED: Button alignment (Left/Center/Right) with live admin preview
- ADDED: Alignment shortcode attribute `align="left|center|right"`
- ENHANCED: Shortcode now takes precedence over auto-inject on pages where it’s used
- ENHANCED: Prevent multiple Call Bars when shortcode is inserted more than once
- POLISH: Inline help paragraph with three shortcode examples inside the Call Bar settings
- DEFAULT: Mobile-only behavior retained; desktop remains off by default
