## DETAILED FEATURE BREAKDOWN

### üîß CORE FUNCTIONALITY (What's Working)
```php
// These functions are intact and working:
- leadstream_analytics_settings_page() 
- leadstream_analytics_settings_display()
- leadstream_analytics_settings_init()
- leadstream_header_js_field_callback()
- leadstream_footer_js_field_callback()
- leadstream_sanitize_javascript()
- leadstream_inject_header_js()
- leadstream_inject_footer_js()
```

- leadstream_check_ga_plugin_conflicts()
- leadstream_analytics_admin_notices()
- leadstream_sanitize_gtm_id()

- Basic scroll depth (75% only)
- Alert-based feedback

#### Lost Enhanced Script (Comprehensive)
- Multi-platform tracking (GA4, TikTok, Facebook, Triple Whale)
- Advanced form tracking (Gravity Forms, generic forms)
- Comprehensive scroll tracking (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Time on page tracking (30s, 60s, 2min, 5min)
- Video interaction tracking
- Enhanced console logging
- Professional error handling
- Console-based feedback instead of alerts

## WHAT WE NEED TO REBUILD

### Priority 1 (Critical)
1. **Plugin Conflict Detection** - Warns about duplicate GA tracking
2. **Google Tag Manager Integration** - GTM container ID field
3. **Enhanced Starter Script** - Comprehensive multi-platform examples

### Priority 2 (Important) 
1. **Admin Notices System** - Success/error messages
2. **Enhanced Admin Styling** - Professional UI
3. **Advanced Form Validation** - GTM ID format checking

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
1. **Advanced Event Examples** - Video, time tracking, etc.
2. **Enhanced Security Notices** - More detailed warnings
3. **Professional Console Logging** - Better debugging

## LESSONS LEARNED

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well
- Git backup strategy saved us from total loss
- Core plugin architecture remained solid
- Basic functionality never broke

### ‚ùå What Went Wrong
- No incremental backups during development
- No change log maintained during building
- No documentation of features as they were added
- Attempted risky debugging without backup

### üîÑ Process Improvements Needed
- Commit to Git after each major feature addition
- Maintain running change log during development
- Document each new function as it's added
- Never attempt major debugging without current backup
